# SQL Task: Language School System

## Scenario

You are designing a database for a Language School that tracks Students and Courses.

One student can enroll in multiple courses (e.g., English and Spanish).

One course can be attended by multiple students.

## Part 1: Schema Design
Please design the database schema to handle this scenario. List the tables, columns, and keys (Primary/Foreign) required
to model this relationship properly.

# Part 2: Reporting Query
Based on your schema, write a SQL query that returns a list of courses with their popularity. The result should include:

* The Course Title.
* The Count of Students enrolled in that course.

Requirement: Sort the results so that the most popular course appears at the top.
